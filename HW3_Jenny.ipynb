A U.S. offer last fall\\n to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export\\n enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.\\n     Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat\\n offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major\\n obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet\\n Union, grain industry sources said.\\n     Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat\\n offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in\\n recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose\\n another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,\\n while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.\\n     \"I\\'m not sure this is an about-face, but it\\'s clearly a\\n recognition that unless we\\'re competitive, we won\\'t sell to the\\n Soviet Union,\" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.\\n     \"We have to be competitive. It\\'s ridiculous to say that\\n somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same\\n thing at a lower price somewhere else,\" Shultz told the farm\\n leaders. \"That is our approach in negotiations with the\\n Soviets,\" he said.\\n     If those comments do signal that the State Department is no\\n longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,\\n it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to\\n Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.\\n     National Wheat Grower\\'s officials were taking a cautious\\n attitude towards the secretary\\'s comments.\\n     \"His comments were not discouraging, but they didn\\'t in our\\n judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,\" an official with\\n the wheat group said.\\n     The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that \"there is\\n significance in that fact that we haven\\'t seen any significant\\n negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.\"\\n     In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of\\n Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request\\n that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the\\n officials said.\\n     An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is\\n reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,\\n said that the Shultz comments \"are consistent with what he\\n (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,\" but said they\\n don\\'t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.\\n     Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to\\n Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz\\'s statements.\\n     But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may\\n indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.\\n     \"If he didn\\'t say no, then there\\'s a chance.
