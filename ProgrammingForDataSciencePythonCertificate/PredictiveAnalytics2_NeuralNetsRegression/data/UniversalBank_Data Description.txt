Background:								
								
A relatively young bank is growing rapidly in terms of overall customer acquisition. 								
Majority of these are Liability customers with varying sizes of relationship with the bank.								
The customer base of Asset customers is quite small, and the bank WANTS to grow								
this base rapidly to bring in more loan business. 								
								
Specifically, it wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to 								
Personal Loan customers.								
								
A campaign the bank ran for liability customers last year showed a healthy conversion								
rate of over 9% successes. This has encouraged the Retail Marketing department 								
to devise smarter campaigns with better target marketing.								
								
Analytics Objectives:								
								
While designing a new campaign, can we model the previous campaign's customer behavior to 								
analyze what combination of parameters make a customer more likely to 								
accept a personal loan?								
								
There are several special products / facilities the bank offers like CD and security accounts, 								
online services, credit cards, etc. Can we spot any association among these								
for finding cross-selling opportunities?
